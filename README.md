## üöÄ Features

* **Permutations (P(n,r)):** Calculate the number of ways to arrange 'r' items from a set of 'n' distinct items.
* **Combinations (C(n,r)):** Determine the number of ways to choose 'r' items from a set of 'n' distinct items, without regard to the order of selection.
* **Inversions:** Count the number of inversions in a given permutation sequence.
* **User-Friendly Web Interface:** A clean and intuitive UI to perform calculations.
* **API Endpoints:** Access the calculator's core functionality programmatically via dedicated REST API endpoints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

* **Backend:** Python 3.11+ with Flask
* **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* **Web Server:** Gunicorn
* **Containerization:** Docker
* **Deployment:** Render

## üíª How to Use

### Web Interface

1.  **Select Calculation:** Choose between Permutations, Combinations, or Inversions.
2.  **Enter Values:**
    * For **Permutations** and **Combinations**: Input the "Total number of elements (n)" and "Elements to choose (r)".
    * For **Inversions**: Enter a sequence of numbers separated by spaces (e.g., `3 1 4 2`).
3.  **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate" or "Count Inversions" button.
4.  **View Result:** The result, along with the relevant formula (for P & C), will be displayed. Any errors will be shown in red.

### API Endpoints

You can integrate this calculator's functionality into your own applications using the following API endpoints:

* **Permutations:**
    * **GET `/api/permutations/<n>/<r>`**
    * **Example:** `GET /api/permutations/5/3`
    * **Response:** `{"result": 60, "formula": "P(5,3)"}`

* **Combinations:**
    * **GET `/api/combinations/<n>/<r>`**
    * **Example:** `GET /api/combinations/5/3`
    * **Response:** `{"result": 10, "formula": "C(5,3)"}`
